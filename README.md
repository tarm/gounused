'gounused' finds unused assignments in your code.

The compiler checks for unused variables, but sometimes assignments
are never read before getting overwriten or ignored.  For example this
code:


	package main
	
	import "fmt"
	
	func main() {
	     _, err := fmt.Println("Hello")
	     _, err = fmt.Println(" world")
	     _, err = fmt.Println(err)
	}

The err variable is used so the compiler does not complain, but the
first and third assignment to the err variable are never checked.
'gounused' finds that mistake as follows:


	$ gounused ./testdata/
	Unused assignment for 'err' ./testdata/test.go:6:5
	Unused assignment for 'err' ./testdata/test.go:8:5
	$ echo $?
	1
